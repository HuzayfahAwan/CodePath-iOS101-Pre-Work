## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

 -  Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your  
    favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps Example App: Instagram (changing the background color of the 
    messages screen, deleting old messages, etc.)
    
    - YouTube
        -   The Subscriptions tab of the app because it gives me the option to only focus on content-creators that I'm actually invested in and that will actually provide me with value and knowledge that I can implement in my life (I don't like to waste time on social media and try to not do so as best as possible.)
        -   The feature where you can preview videos with both captions and sound and skim through the video's content by hovering over it before even clicking on it because it allows you to see if the video might actually be of interest to you.
        
    - Medito
        -   I love the minimalistic design of this app and how it outlines everything in a non-overwhelming manner through the use of cards/icons.
        -   The app is very informative and contains courses that teach you how to meditate properly and train your brain to focus. As a user, I can say the theme of the app matches the app's content.
        
        
    - Muslim Pro
        -   The app has a built-in compass that allows one to figure out which direction they should be praying in (i.e which direction faces towards the Kaaba). It is incredibly useful especially when I'm in an umfamiliar environment.
        -   The app is very customizable and you can choose different imams each with their own style of reciting the call-to-prayer, and the app notifies you when it is time to pray.

-   Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

    -   I would like to build an app that allows people to track their gym workouts. However, I don't want it to be a stereotypical gym app where you track the weight, reps, calories, etc. Obviously, the app should contain those features as they are essential, but most importantly I want it to contan a feature that psychologically manipulates the user in a healthy manner. What I mean by this is the following: the app contains levels of working-out kind of like a video game. Users state their experience level at the beginning when it comes to the gym and working out. Users take a brief quiz that determines a style of working-out that best aligns with their goals. After this, the user is given free workout routines that align with their goals and the determined style of working-out from the quiz given beforehand. The user can log workouts, log calories, log their weight, and all of that good stuff; however, on top of that, the app will also tell them when they "level-up" in the gym, providing the user with dopamine, which allows them to experience delayed gratification and a heightened sense of pride and motivations, which will keep them coming back to the gym to level-up more. Users level-up when there is evidence of them getting stronger in the gym based on whether they're progressively overloading or not (doing more reps, sets, pushing more weight, etc.) This is a fun app idea that will allow users to not only do everything that a basic fitness app allows you to do, but also will allow users to not forget how far they've came in their fitness journeys since it can be easy to feel frustrated when you feel that your progress is stagnating.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

    -   Some challenges that I encountered while building the app was figuring out how to change the colors of the labels similar to how the functionality to change the color of the background was implemented. I spent some time figuring out how to access the textColor property of the label and finally understood that first I needed to drag the labels and the "change label colors" button from the Storyboard into the ViewController subclass, and then from there I needed to generate random colors for each of my labels on-screen similar to how it was done for the random background colors. Also, Swift syntax is not that familiar to me. I am more comfortable with Java and C++ and only know the basics of Python, which is sort of similar to Swift. I am also a bit familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have made some websites using my limited knowledge paired with documentation of those languages. I'm excited to see how learning iOS development will allow me to further express my creative ideas compared to how I expressed them in website form.
